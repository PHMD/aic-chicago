            <p>The Arts area focuses on providing the opportunity for first voice American Indian representation. American
                Indian artists seldom have the opportunity to be involved with the manner in which their art is represented
                to the general public. The AIC offers a grand space community art development.</p>

            <h3>Drummers and Singers at AIC</h3>
            <p>The powwow is a center piece of contemporary American Indian culture that thrives in Chicago, featuring
                regalia-making, drumming, singing and dancing. The AIC hosts a year-long calendar of powwows, ranging from
                small celebrations for birthdays or special events, to regular holiday powwows, to the large-scale two-day
                Annual Chicago Powwow held every year since 1953. Our 61st Annual Powwow will be held September 13-14, 2014
                in Busse Woods, Elk Grove Village, IL. Powwows are both a social gathering place for the American Indian
                community and an educational opportunity to share diverse American Indian traditions and culture with
                spectators and visitors of all ethnic backgrounds.</p>

            <h3>Arts Programming</h3>
            <p>The American Indian Center has worked with many local and state museums to bring contemporary images of the
                powwow to various communities in the “50 Years of Powwow” photo exhibit. The American Indian Center is also
                a part of the “Our Lives” exhibit at the newly opened National Museum of the American Indian of the
                Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC.</p>

                    <p>The American Indian Center, Inc. (AIC) continues to be a primary
                        cultural and community resource for nearly 65,000 American Indians
                        in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago is the third largest
                        urban Native American population in the country with over 100 tribal
                        nations represented. Since 1953, AIC continues to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advance the academic progress of our youth</li>
                        <li>Create health access opportunities for our elders</li>
                        <li>Provide food and hot meals to seniors and families</li>
                        <li>Culturally educate, share and engage schools and businesses through professional development
                            for the
                            desired attainment of cultural understanding
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Providing successful direct service programs for 61 years does come with obstacles. The AIC is
                        continuously challenged and focused to address community concerns that include poverty, hunger
                        and
                        education issues. We are grateful to our donors, volunteers and dedicated staff for sustaining
                        vital
                        work that continues to help so many families in need. Your dollars go a long way in supporting
                        our
                        programs.</p>

                        that you

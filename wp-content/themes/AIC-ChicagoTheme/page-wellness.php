            <p>The Wellness area of the American Indian Center focuses on the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual
            wellbeing of community members. The holistic approach to health means considering the environment as well
            and programs include: Medicinal Garden, Senior Lunches and Social Services (offers food and clothing).</p>

            <h3>Social Services</h3>
            <p>The American Indian Center was established in response to many needs of the rapidly growing Native American
            community in Chicago. Many families moved because of the Federal Relocation Act of 1953 and Natives who were
            presently living in Chicago (they refer to themselves as “old timers”) needed a space to practice cultural
            traditions and socialize with fellow Native Americans. The AIC continues to offer a food pantry and clothing
            to assist family and individuals in need. The Social Services program also organizes the Community Giving
            Thanks and Winter Feast Celebration for all community members to attend.</p>
            <hr/>

            <h3>AIC Medicinal Garden Medicinal Garden</h3>
            <p>Last year the garden produced several types of medicines such as sage, sweet grass and tobacco and were able
            to use these in ceremonies at the AIC.</p>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Senior Program</h3>
            <p>We continue to provide a weekly meal for seniors 55 and over. Lunch is served at noon – 12:30 pm. Health
            Screening are available through American Indian Health Services.</p>

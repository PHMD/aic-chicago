            <p>The American Indian Center of Chicago was organized in 1953 by the Chicago Indian community, with an
                important assist from the American Friends Service Committee, in response to a flood of the first people of
                this country from reservations throughout North America. The Indian Relocation Act of the ’50s, operated in
                concert with a policy of selective termination of tribal status, was a concerted attempt to break up the
                reservation system. Chicago was the only one of the five original relocation cities without a large in-state
                reservation. As a result, Native people from tribes throughout the country, arrived in Chicago. In addition
                to the Oneida, Ojibwa, Menominee, Sac and Fox, and Potawatomi of the north woods, Lakota, Navajo, Blackfoot,
                Papago, and many others were represented. The result was (and is) a multi-tribal community (including
                members of more than 50 tribes) searching for a common social and cultural ground.</p>

            <p>Implementation of the Relocation Program sent thousands of Natives to the city, where they quickly began to
                find life difficult and challenging in an unfamiliar environment. In important ways, it has served as a
                model for the many urban centers and other social service and educational organizations that have arisen
                throughout the country. In addition, AIC has provided a beginning space for many Native American programs in
                the Chicago area.</p>

            <p>Changing dramatically over the years, in response to the changing nature and needs of the Chicago Indian
                community, AIC has introduced many of the academic, health, and social service programs that have become
                viable, independent agencies in their own right. In all those years, certain elements of AIC operation have
                remained constant.</p>

            <p>From the beginning, AIC has been a brave experiment in community self-determination. Managed by a Board of
                Directors comprised of Native Americans elected from out of the Chicago Indian community, the Center has
                steadfastly supported the collaboration between the service population and the managers.</p>


            <pr>American Indian Center of Chicago PowwowThroughout its history, AIC has been the principal cultural resource
                for Indian Chicago. The big building at 1630 W. Wilson (its location since 1966) has been a gathering place
                for hundreds of natives on a regular basis. The Center has hosted powwows, potlucks, bingo, birthdays,
                special celebrations, wakes, commemorative dinners and countless special events. When Chicago’s Indians need
                to get together, this is where they come. In a similar vein, AIC has been the point of origin for a number
                of experimental and successful educational programs. We have seen elementary school, high school, headstart,
                tutorial, and summer day camp programs take root and flourish here; many of them have gone on to successful
                independent operation out of our building. We have been the site of gift shops, art galleries, and theaters.</pr>
